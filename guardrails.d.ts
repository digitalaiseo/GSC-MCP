 * These ensure Claude sticks to the data returned by the GSC API

 * with assumptions from its training data.

 * Inspired by feedback from Krinal Mehta (https://www.linkedin.com/in/krinal/)

export declare const GUARDRAIL_SUFFIX = " IMPORTANT: Base your analysis ONLY on the data returned. Report exact numbers from the results. Do not speculate about causes (e.g. algorithm updates, competitor actions) unless the data explicitly supports it. If the data does not contain enough information to answer a question, say so clearly rather than guessing.";
export declare const VISUAL_SUFFIX = " PRESENTATION: Always present these results as a rich, interactive visualization using artifacts. Use summary cards for key metrics, colour-coded indicators for severity or change direction (green for positive, red for negative), bar charts or sparklines for comparisons, and tabbed sections to organise different categories of results. Make the output visually scannable and dashboard-like rather than plain text or raw tables.";

 * Wraps tool results with a _meta provenance field so Claude
